### Hi there 👋, I'm Daniele!

"The only constant in life is change" – Heraclitus 

- 🏡 I’m a Junior Web Developer based in Munich, Germany
- 💻 I discovered my passion for web development working as the responsible project manager for the development of a web platform for speciality coffee. At the beginning of 2022, I decided to dive deep into frontend development and attended an intensive web development boot camp @neuefische. 
- After falling in love 💓 with coding, I accepted the challenge to change my profession after 11 years of marketing and PR to bring my understanding of inspiring storytelling and modern design to the creation of outstanding digital experiences.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in Italy but I'm not able to cook a decent Pizza 🍕!
